# Timing attack 


When attempting to crack a password, a timing attack can be carried out by analyzing the time it takes for a system to verify a password against a database or perform a comparison. The idea behind this attack is that the time taken to process incorrect password guesses will differ from the time taken for a correct password guess. By carefully measuring and analyzing these time differences, an attacker can gain insights and potentially deduce information about the correct password.


The provided code implements a basic password attack simulation in Python. It demonstrates the process of cracking a password by attempting different variations until the correct password is found. The code is designed for **educational purposes** only and should not be used for any malicious intent.
